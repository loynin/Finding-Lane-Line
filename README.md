# Self-Driving Car

## Project: Finding Lane Line  
  
### 1. Description:

This project is using OpenCV and Python to calculate the lane line on the road. By importing the video that were token while driving car, this program will use Computer Vision technology to read and fine the lane on the road. After the lane has been found, it will draw the annotation line on the lane line of the road and it will produce the new video showing the annotation line on the new video.

### 2. Technology:  
  
This project used OpenCV and Python to program and process the video in order to find the result which is to find the lane line on the road.

### 3. Files:
  
There is three files for this project, and they are README.md (this file), writeup.md, and FindingLaneLine.ipynb.  

### 4. Running:

This project is run from jupyter notebook.
